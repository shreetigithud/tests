Q1. Consider a database schema that represents an online bookstore with two tables: books and orders.
The books table has columns: book_id, title, author, price, and stock_quantity.
The orders table has columns: order_id, book_id, quantity, and order_date.Write an SQL query
to find the top 3 bestselling products in terms of total quantity sold, along with their names and total quantities sold

Ans:-SELECT b.title AS product_name, SUM(o.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM books AS b
JOIN orders AS o ON b.book_id = o.book_id
GROUP BY b.title
ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC
LIMIT 3;
