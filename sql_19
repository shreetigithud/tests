  who have made the most orders, along with the total count of their orders. Display the results in descending order of the order count and ascending order of customer names.


ANS:-SELECT c.customer_name, COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count
FROM Customers AS c
JOIN Orders AS o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_name
ORDER BY order_count DESC, customer_name ASC
LIMIT 5;
